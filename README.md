# SVMGrad
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nbfigueroa/SVMGrad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nbfigueroa/SVMGrad) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/72996644.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/72996644)

SVMGrad is a compact library used to evaluate the decision function of a
Gaussian RBF Kernel Support Vector Machine, as well as the its first Derivative (Gradient). 

```
y = sign(Gamma(x))
Gamma   = \sum_{i=1}^{N_sv}\alpha_iy_ik(x,x_i) + b 
DGamma  = \sum_{i=1}^{N_sv}-1/2\sigma^2\alpha_iy_ik(x,x_i)(x-x_i)
DDGamma = ...
```
The evaluated SVM model can be learned with any toolbox: libSVM, SMVlight, EnsembleSVM, etc.. as long as the user creates a 
simplified struct model. In MATLAB one should create the following struct instance:
```
model.nClass: # of Classes (2 for binary)
model.nSV   : Total # of Support Vectors
model.b     : Offset for classification function
model.sigma : Gaussian RBF kernel Width
model.alphas: Values for the Lagrangian multipliers per SVs  [nSV]
model.y     : Labels corresponding to SVs                    [nSV]
model.SVs   : Set of Support Vectors                         [DxnSV]
```

## Matlab Usage
In the ```./matlab/``` folder you can find an example script together with sample 2d datasets and learnt models (through libSVM). Make sure to add all subfolders to your current directory and run the following script:
```
2d_svmgrad_example.m
```
This should generate the following plot, which shows the svm ```Gamma``` being evaluated on a mesh of points as well as its gradient ```DGamma```:

## C++ Installation (Catkin package)
These instrutions are assuming you have a ROS environment and use catkin workspace to compile code. 
Clone this respository in your ```./src``` folder and make sure that you have the [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) library, you can install this by 
```
sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev
```
Then, compile the package
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

## C++ Usage
First one must have an svm model in the format requested by ```svm_grad``` class, this can be generated with the ```writeSVMGradModel.m``` function in the matlab folder, then:
```
SVMGrad svm_(modelFilename);
x = load vector...              // Could Eigen::VectorXd or arma::vec<double> format
svm_.preComputeKernel(true);    // For fast derivative computation
gamma       = svm_.calculateGamma(x);
gamma_grad  = svm_.calculateGammaDerivative(x);
```
You can try the testing script as well, this was generated by compiling the library,  type the following:
```
rosrun svm_grad test_svmgrad
```
This test will load a stored svm-model (the one generating the figure above) and a testing dataset. It will check for numerical errors and output average function computation time for [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) inputs as well as [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) inputs:
```
