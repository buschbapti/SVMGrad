# SVMGrad
SVMgrad is a simple standalone library used to evaluate an SVM decision function (from a pre-learned SVM), as well as its gradient and laplacian (first and second derivatives).

Note: This code is based on the [ASVM library](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/A-SVM) provided by Dr. Ashwini Shukla.
