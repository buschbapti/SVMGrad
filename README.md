# SVMGrad
SVMGrad is a simple standalone library used to evaluate an SVM decision function (from a pre-learned SVM), as well as its first (gradient) and second order derivative, which can be used to compute the Jacobian and Hessian matrices of the function.

##Installation
Extract the SVMGrad folder to any location.
```
$ cd <SVM_grad_root_dir>
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ccmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

##Usage
bla bla bla


Note: Part of this code was derived from the [ASVM library](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/A-SVM) implemented by Dr. Ashwini Shukla.
