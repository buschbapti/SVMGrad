# SVMGrad
SVMGrad is a simple standalone library used to evaluate an SVM decision function (from a pre-learned SVM), as well as its first (gradient) and second order derivative, which can be used to compute the Jacobian and Hessian matrices of the function.

Note: This code is based on the [ASVM library](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/A-SVM) provided by Dr. Ashwini Shukla.
